HundredGamer:           word up yoshisaur munchakoopas is my name, and i'ma tell you how i beat the irs at their own game. i lied on my tax forms cause i just don't give a fuck, now i'm practically swimming around in big bucks. i got 12 million dollars in my attic undeclared, and i got another million more right under my stairs. i do my business deals under cover of the night so i can hide the cash away from uncle sam without a fight. i take advantage of every loophole even ones that don't apply. it's been 20 years still haven't been caught in a lie. i claimed baby mario as a dependent though he ain't my kid, and made up charity work i never even did. i must have cheated on my tax forms at least a hundred times; so many clever tricks i can't fit 'em all into rhymes. yoshi is my name, money laundering is my game, and commiting tax fraud is worth every single dime. i'm a tax dodging badass, i don't play by the rules. i make the government look like a bunch of damn fools. i keep 99 cents of every dollar that i make. nothing makes me cum faster than a good old tax break. i hate paying taxes if there's anything i hate. i supported ron paul back in 2008. you might think it's unfair that i don't have to pay, but it's ok because taxation is theft anyway
