Synch Failure  ->   #spawn

2018-08-23 20:56:06.549000

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 20:56:14.233000

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 20:56:21.008000
DylanNeyaz:           which is why mid season 1 to end season 1 was best

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 20:56:31.274000
DylanNeyaz:           the only gay thing they had was garnet being a fusion and they didn't show that off

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 20:56:59.835000
DylanNeyaz:           plus the animation was consistent during that time and the writing wasn't shit

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 20:57:15.772000

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:03:47.350000
DylanNeyaz:           that's like pink not being mentioned until the final arc of season 3

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:03:57.318000
DylanNeyaz:           which was also bullshit

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:04:02.463000
DylanNeyaz:           one huge thing that limits the show very badly

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:04:10.250000
DylanNeyaz:           is that the show _has_ to be from steven's perspective

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn

DylanNeyaz:           the only time we get to see stuff steven wasn't a part of is when it's a flashback

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:05:26.346000
DylanNeyaz:           or a story

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:05:34.715000
DylanNeyaz:           that a character is telling him

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:05:38.458000
DylanNeyaz:           we don't know anything steven doesn't know

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:05:50.747000
DylanNeyaz:           it worked fine during seasons 1 and 2 but

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:05:58.834000
DylanNeyaz:           they should've fucking branched away from that when season 3 started

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:06:03.777000
DylanNeyaz:           because shit was and is getting real

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:06:16.102000
DylanNeyaz:           but no

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:06:17.059000
DylanNeyaz:           they just

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:06:19.322000
DylanNeyaz:           fucked it all up

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:10:13.956000
Vanto:           wait are we already in season 6

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:10:23.859000
Vanto:           I thought they said the show was ending in season 5 or something like that lol

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:10:57.815000
DylanNeyaz:           yeah but

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:11:03.589000
DylanNeyaz:           that was before the show got split

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:11:03.838000
DylanNeyaz:           as in

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:11:11.243000
DylanNeyaz:           season 2 and season 3 are supposed to be one season

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:11:22.767000
DylanNeyaz:           that's why they're 26 episodes each while season 1 was 52 episodes

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:11:47.043000
DylanNeyaz:           so season 4 and 5 are also supposed to be one season

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:11:53.588000
DylanNeyaz:           we can assume the same for every two seasons that have 26 episodes

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:12:02.578000
DylanNeyaz:           which means it may end at season 9

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:12:21.899000
DylanNeyaz:           which would've been season 5 if they didn't split the seasons

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:12:27.181000
DylanNeyaz:           i believe CN were responsible for splitting them

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
2018-08-23 21:12:28.074000
DylanNeyaz:           or something

Synch Failure  ->   #spawn
